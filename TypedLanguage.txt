A strongly-typed programming language is one in which each type of data 
(such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) 
is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants or 
variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the data types.

Strongly typed languages
A strongly-typed language is one in which variables are bound to specific data types, 
and will result in type errors if types do not match up as expected in the expression — regardless of when type checking occurs.
Python is strong-typed, and so is Java.
	Python Example
	temp = “Hello World!”
	temp = temp + 10; // program terminates with below stated error
